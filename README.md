## CODTECH-Task2
## PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple linear regression model to predict continuous target variables. By using a synthetic dataset, the project showcases the process of training a linear regression model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the results.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to:
- Implement a linear regression model to understand the relationship between a single feature and a target variable.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
- Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.

## Key Activities

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Creation of a synthetic dataset with feature `X` and target variable `y`.

2. **Data Splitting:**
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Training a linear regression model using the training data.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluating the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics on both training and testing data.

5. **Visualization:**
   - Plotting the regression line to visualize the relationship between `X` and `y`.
   - Visualizing actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for the implementation.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** For implementing and evaluating the linear regression model.

## Key Insights

- The linear regression model helps in understanding the linear relationship between the feature `X` and the target variable `y`.
- The Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics provide a quantitative measure of the model's performance.
- Visualizing the regression line and the actual vs. predicted values gives a clear indication of how well the model fits the data.
